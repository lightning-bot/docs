# Message Reports

Lightning includes a powerful, easy-to-use message reporting system.

## Set Up

Type `@Lightning reportsetup`. 

Click or tap the Set report channel button. Then, select the channel you want reports sent to. 

**This channel should be accessible only to your server's moderators and admins.**

Once you finished, your server's members will now be able to report suspicious or rule breaking messages.

## How to report messages

Right-click on a message, hover over Apps, and click Report Message.

Once you get a confirmation, the message will show up in your configured reports channel.


Included below is an example of how to report messages.

### Message Report Dashboard

When a member reports a message, a new message will appear in your configured reports channel. This will allow your moderators to decide what to do with the message.
