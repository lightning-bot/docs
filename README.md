# Lightning

A Discord bot offering powerful moderation for your server!

### Why choose Lightning?

Many popular Discord bots fall short when it comes to comprehensive and easy-to-use moderation features. They often require multiple bots or involve confusing setups, like .yml files or complicated command syntax. Lightning eliminates these barriers and offers your server the best of both worlds. It's designed to be user-friendly and effortlessly configurable while providing advanced moderation features all in one package.

#### Noteworthy features you don't normally find in popular Discord bots
- **Multiple Mod Log Formats:** Flexible mod log options to fit your server's needs.
- **Customizable AutoMod:**  Automatically manage spam and unwanted content with ease and customizability.
- **Integrated Mod Logs with Discord's Audit Log:** Keep all your server actions well-documented and organized.
- **Support for Multiple Mod Log Channels:** Set up public mod logs for transparency and private ones for your moderation team.
